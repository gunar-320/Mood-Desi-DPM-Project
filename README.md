## What is Mood-Desi
Mood Desi is an web based application that can detect mood based upon the facial recognition. The System uses the camera of the device and does live facial analysis. The Model's architecture consists of Facial detection and Emotion classification. The Facial Detection's Model is trained on WIDER FACE dataset. This model is used for classifying the faces. The Facial Expression classification was trained on Affect Net Dataset to classify as per the facial expression. 
The Output is given in form of number which can be tracked to mood and each mood is then reflected by a live Analysis of the face which is shown as output on the screen.
Later after the session, An output is given in form of Bokeh Plot which shows the summary of the mood and emotions in the considered time period.
